**Important side-note:** remember, ordinal variables are not metric, so you cannot treat them the same way. For example, you cannot compute a mean response because computation of the mean assumes, among other things, that all factors are equidistant from each other (i.e., `("agree" - "neither agree, nor disagree") == ("neither agree, nor disagree" - "disagree")` and that `2 * ("agree" - "neither agree, nor disagree") == ("agree" - "disagree")`). In reality, most likely this is not the case, particularly when you have more response options (people are typically vary of using extreme values). And, to make things worse, this differences between individual levels will be most probably different for different participants. This issue is not so much about data analysis per se (although, not computing mean response is a good start), but rather about using a correct statistical procedure to analyze ordinal data. If you work with ordinal data (and, if you in psychology then you almost certainly use Likert scale), I strongly recommend reading [Analyzing ordinal data with metric models: What could possibly go wrong?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103117307746) paper by Liddell and Kruschke (as of writing, a PDF is freely available at [hbiostat.org](http://hbiostat.org/papers/ordinal/lid18ana.pdf)).

**Another important side-note:** computers are golems, not oracles. Having read the previous paragraph, you may ask yourself: _What if I convert scales to numbers, so that `"disagree"=1`, `"neither agree, nor disagree"=2`, and `"agree"=3` and compute mean of numbers?_. Yep, you can do that! _Will I get some "average" numbers, if I compute mean of these numbers?_ Yes, you will! _Will statistics police knock on my door, if I do that?_ No, it wont! _So, all is good?_ Nope. The fact that computer did not crash and did spit out some numbers, does not mean that these numbers mean anything. Computers are [golems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem), not [oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle). They will perform a computation you've asked for even if it makes no sense. Computers don't know what you are doing, why are you doing it, and whether it is a valid approach. Computers don't care if you are treating ordinal data as metric or using ANOVA on proportional data. They will carry out the computation and will give the result. Unfortunately, it is _on you_ to know whether results are valid or are even interpretable. The worst case scenario is using a complex analysis without understanding how it actually works and which assumptions it uses. You will have no way of knowing whether your results are valid but might hope that "computer knows what it is doing". This is when you start having a problem because you are flying blind without even realizing that. To summarize, _you_ must know that what you are doing is valid and correct, not the computer!

Now that I've vented my feelings about using inappropriate analysis procedures, let's get back to factors!
